# C++ Pharmacy Application using File Handling

This repository contains a C++ program for managing a pharmacy application using file handling. The application allows users to perform various operations such as adding medicines, displaying medicine lists, searching for specific medicines, and selling medicines to customers.

## Code Structure
The main functionality of the application is implemented through a C++ class `pharmacy`. This class contains methods for adding, displaying, searching, and selling medicines. The main program is in the `main()` function, where users interact with the application through a menu-driven interface.

## Dependencies
The code uses standard C++ libraries such as `<iostream>`, `<fstream>`, and `<string.h>`.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile the C++ code using a C++ compiler.
3. Run the compiled executable to start the pharmacy application.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate through the menu and perform various operations.

## Features
- **Add Medicines**: Users can add different types of medicines such as capsules, tablets, liquids, and ayurvedic medicines along with their respective costs.
